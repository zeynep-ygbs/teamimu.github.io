TEAM IMU was established in 2018 and consists of Istanbul Medeniyet University Field Robotic Laboratory and Robotics Club members.
TEAM IMU consists of a group of engineering students who have adopted the principle of learning the basics of projects carried out in the field of robotics, developing both software and hardware and implementing them. 
Our basic principles as a team:
-Design
-R&D
-Software Development
-Hardware Development

Supervisor Haluk Bayram works as a full-time lecturer in the department of Electrical and Electronics Engineering (EEE) at İstanbul Medeniyet University (İMU). 
He worked on multi-robot systems during his doctoral studies at Boğaziçi University. 
He developed target positioning and tracking algorithms for floating-base systems and multi-rotor flying systems and performed them on real robotic systems in his post-doctoral research at the University of Minnesota Department of Computer Science.
