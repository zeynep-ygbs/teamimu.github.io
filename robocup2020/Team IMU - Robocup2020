TEAM IMU was established in 2018 and consists of members from Field Robotics Laboratory and Robotics Student Club at Istanbul Medeniyet University. TEAM IMU develops algorithms for various robotic problems and implements them on real robotic systems. Team leader, Haluk Bayram, works as a full-time professor in the department of Electrical and Electronics Engineering (EEE) at Istanbul Medeniyet University (IMU). He is the director of Field Robotics Laboratory, working on multi-robot systems and developing task allocation, target localization and navigation algorithms for ground, aerial and surface robots. The publication list can be seen in [ref]. The first competition TEAM IMU participated in is the TUBITAK International Unmanned Aerial Vehicle Competition in 2018. In this competition, the team participated in the fixed wing category with the HORIZON vehicle. TEAM IMU participated in the Rotary Wings Category in the TUBITAK International Unmanned Aerial Vehicle Competition in 2019.  In the conceptual design phase, the teamâ€™s VTOL design was placed seventh out of 187 teams competing. The aim of these contests is to develop  Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) for civil use, which will help people especially in emergencies, such as fire or accident
